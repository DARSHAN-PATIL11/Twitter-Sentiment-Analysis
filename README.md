## 📌 **Sentiment Predictor**
A deep learning-based sentiment analysis model that classifies tweets as positive or negative.

## 📝 **Overview**  
Sentiment Predictor is a **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** project that analyzes the sentiment of tweets. It processes raw text, converts it into numerical representations, and uses a **neural network model** to classify the sentiment as **positive or negative**.  


## 🚀 **Features**  
✅ Predicts tweet sentiment with **high accuracy**  
✅ Uses **deep learning (Keras & TensorFlow)** for classification  
✅ Preprocesses text by **removing noise, tokenizing, and vectorizing**  
✅ Implements **one-hot encoding & padded sequences** for NLP processing

## 🏗 **Tech Stack**  
- **Programming Language**: Python 🐍  
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Data Processing**: Tokenization, Stopword Removal, One-Hot Encoding  
- **Model Architecture**: Deep Learning with Embedding Layers  


## 📂 **Dataset**  
The model is trained on a dataset containing **50,000+ labeled tweets**. Each tweet is classified as either **positive (1)** or **negative (0)**. The dataset undergoes preprocessing before feeding into the model.  


## 🔧 **Installation & Setup**  

1️⃣ **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sentiment-Predictor.git
cd Sentiment-Predictor
```
  
2️⃣ **Install dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  
3️⃣ **Run the model**  
```bash

## 📌 **Usage Example**  
```python
from predictor import predict_sentiment  

text = "I love this product! It's amazing!"  
print(predict_sentiment(text))  # Output: Positive  
```
