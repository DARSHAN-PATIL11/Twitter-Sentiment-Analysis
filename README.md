A deep learning-based sentiment analysis model that classifies tweets as positive or negative.

## Overview

Sentiment Predictor is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that analyzes the sentiment of tweets. It processes raw text, converts it into numerical representations, and uses a neural network model to classify the sentiment as positive or negative.

## Features

- Predicts tweet sentiment with high accuracy
- Uses deep learning (Keras & TensorFlow) for classification
- Preprocesses text by removing noise, tokenizing, and vectorizing
- Implements one-hot encoding & padded sequences for NLP processing

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Data Processing**: Tokenization, Stopword Removal, One-Hot Encoding
- **Model Architecture**: Deep Learning with Embedding Layers

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing 50,000+ labeled tweets. Each tweet is classified as either positive (1) or negative (0). The dataset undergoes preprocessing before feeding into the model.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sentiment-Predictor.git
   cd Sentiment-Predictor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the model**
   ```bash
   python sentiment_predictor.py
   ```

## Model Training & Performance

The model uses an embedding layer and fully connected neural network to classify tweets.

- **Training Accuracy**: ~90%
- **Test Accuracy**: ~85%
- **Loss Optimization**: Adam Optimizer

### Training Process

The training process involves:

1. Text preprocessing (removing special characters, lowercase conversion)
2. Tokenization and padding sequences
3. Word embedding generation
4. Multi-layer neural network training with dropout for regularization
5. Model evaluation on validation and test sets

## Usage Example

```python
from predictor import predict_sentiment

text = "I love this product! It's amazing!"
print(predict_sentiment(text))  # Output: Positive

text = "This service is terrible and unreliable."
print(predict_sentiment(text))  # Output: Negative
```

## Future Improvements

- Implement transformers (BERT, GPT) for better accuracy
- Expand dataset for multi-class sentiment analysis
- Deploy as an API for real-time predictions
- Add support for multiple languages
- Incorporate contextual understanding for better classification

## Performance Optimization

The model has been optimized for inference speed and accuracy balance. Further optimizations can be made through:

- Model quantization
- Pruning techniques
- Batch processing for high-volume applications

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.0+
- Keras 2.0+
- NumPy 1.19+
- Pandas 1.0+
- Matplotlib 3.0+
